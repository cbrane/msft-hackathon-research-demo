# msft-hackathon-research-demo
- Code for MSFT Babson x Microsoft Hackathon 2024. We had one day to create something using AI to help entrepreneurs find unmet customer needs, so we created a framework for validating customer needs using AI. It is still unfinished as we only had about an hour and a half to develop it. We ended up creating two versions, one using the new crew framework, and one using the old framework to try and get one to work.

## Versions
### New Crew Version
- This is contained in the entrepreneur_validation_crew folder, and uses the new crew framework, using the crew cli to create the structure of the crew.
### Old Crew Version
- This is the 'old_style_crew.py' file, which uses the old style crew framework, where everything is contained in a single file, instead of the new structure.
